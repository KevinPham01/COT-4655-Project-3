## Overview
This app allows users to take photos using the back camera or select photos from their photo album and upload them to the server. Users are only able to view othersâ€™ photos after uploading their own. The app fetches and displays the 10 most recent posts within the last 24 hours, and includes post metadata like time, location, and comments.

## Features
* Use UIImagePickerController to take or select photos from the gallery.
* Upload photos to a Parse-Swift backend server.
* Display comments with usernames and comment content on posts.
* Posts include the time and location metadata.
* Users cannot view other posts until they upload their own.
* Display posts from the last 24 hours based on the user's last upload.
* Posts within 24 hours are shown, others are hidden or blurred.
* Push notification reminder to post a photo daily.
